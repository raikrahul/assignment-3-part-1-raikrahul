00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.220
This video is a demo of
assignment number one.

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.140
So we're going to do an overview walk
through the assignment and also a demo.

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.130
You'll start the assignment off by
clicking on a get help classroom link to

4
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.120
accept it into your get up account.

5
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.118
If you don't already have a get help
account you should create one before you

6
00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:19.377
start the assignment.

7
00:00:19.377 --> 00:00:23.712
And you don't need to use a dedicated or
separate account for this class or for

8
00:00:23.712 --> 00:00:27.661
any of the other courses that you're
taking as a part of the CU course.

9
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.329
Once you do click on
the Github classroom link,

10
00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.478
you should start out with
a new empty repository.

11
00:00:35.478 --> 00:00:39.667
And you're going to fill that
with the content of the base

12
00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:41.772
assignments repository.

13
00:00:41.772 --> 00:00:44.430
And the base assignments repository
looks something like this.

14
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.704
It's going to have a bunch of
starter code implemented for

15
00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:50.851
you that you'll modify as
a part of this assignment.

16
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.552
So then you'll follow the instructions
in the assignment document to

17
00:00:57.552 --> 00:00:58.720
modify the example code.

18
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.722
Commit and push to your individual
Github classroom repository to

19
00:01:01.722 --> 00:01:02.961
complete the assignment.

20
00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.940
So next I'll do a walk through
in a demo of the assignment one.

21
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.253
So as I mentioned in the overview you'll
start each classroom with a Github

22
00:01:11.253 --> 00:01:12.440
classroom link.

23
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.735
When you click that link you'll be
taken to a screen that allows you to

24
00:01:16.735 --> 00:01:18.310
accept the assignment.

25
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.985
And when you accept the assignment,

26
00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:24.340
you'll be creating a repository that
includes your Github user name in it.

27
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.303
So when I click accept this assignment,
I should get this new repository created.

28
00:01:31.303 --> 00:01:33.834
And if I refresh this page,

29
00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:39.580
the repository will be available
at this link that it sets up.

30
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.830
And what you'll notice when you start
here is that the repository is empty, so

31
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.740
the next thing we'll do is
fill that with content.

32
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.100
You'll also notice that the assignment
document is going to include some

33
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.430
suggested reading.

34
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.199
This is including the content
that will go over in class and

35
00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:57.044
also some additional background material
that you might want to review to help you

36
00:01:57.044 --> 00:01:59.240
complete the assignment.

37
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.467
So we'll start the implementation for

38
00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:05.670
assignment one with bringing up your
virtual machine host environment.

39
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.709
It wouldn't need to be a virtual machine
if you want to use a physical machine

40
00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:09.740
that works fine as well.

41
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.640
If you wannaa use a cloud hosted
machine that works as well.

42
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.978
There are some instructions here if you

43
00:02:17.978 --> 00:02:22.990
are going to use the virtual
box based machine.

44
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.340
There's some instructions about how to
set up a virtual box on your host PC.

45
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.974
And referred to the document instructions
for the latest version in use,

46
00:02:31.974 --> 00:02:35.651
the current version is to 20
as a time of this recording.

47
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.040
So do the clone of the get help repository
as I showed in the previous view.

48
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.631
And then that's going to
create the empty repository.

49
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:48.170
One of the things you'll notice when
you create this empty repository.

50
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.970
It gives you some comments here about
what you can do to add content here.

51
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.659
But we don't want to do that
because we're going to add

52
00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.740
content specifically using
the instructions here.

53
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.966
So you'll go through each one of these
instructions to add the base repository,

54
00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:05.265
which is the one that includes content,
for

55
00:03:05.265 --> 00:03:08.760
we'll have content in this repository for
every assignment.

56
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.527
The main branch here is the one that's
going to include the content for

57
00:03:12.527 --> 00:03:13.861
the first assignment.

58
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.871
So you're going to add a remote that
will let get nowhere can fetch that base

59
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:21.230
assignment content.

60
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.367
Then you'll fetch
the assignment content and

61
00:03:24.367 --> 00:03:28.980
then merge it into your main
branch of your current repository.

62
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.950
And so this is going to make your
match the branch from the ASD

63
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.861
assignments repository.

64
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.270
Then you'll do get sub module
update in it recursive.

65
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.059
And what this is going to do is clone
the next to get repositories inside

66
00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:46.140
the assignment auto test.

67
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.443
So if you aren't familiar with
sub modules this is really just

68
00:03:50.443 --> 00:03:54.850
a way to put one Git repository
inside another Git repository.

69
00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.140
You can see this symbol here
next to the folder icon in Git.

70
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.242
And this is just showing that there's a
sub module here referencing a separate Git

71
00:04:04.242 --> 00:04:05.640
repository.

72
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.484
This separate Git reports story is where
all the content is going to be located for

73
00:04:09.484 --> 00:04:11.510
our assignment automated testing.

74
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.071
We'll get into more detail about
this later in the semester.

75
00:04:14.071 --> 00:04:17.690
But for now you just need to make sure
that you're cloning it as a part of your

76
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.740
assignment repository.

77
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.786
So when you do to Git some module update
in a recursive that's going to clone that

78
00:04:23.786 --> 00:04:24.541
repository.

79
00:04:24.541 --> 00:04:28.698
All the nests to Git repository is
going to pull all the test content into

80
00:04:28.698 --> 00:04:29.851
your repository.

81
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.200
Next thing you need to do
is set up Github Actions.

82
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.103
And you can use this for
automated testing and

83
00:04:37.103 --> 00:04:41.996
also to set up your virtual machine or
whatever environment you're using to

84
00:04:41.996 --> 00:04:46.440
run Ubuntu to be able to run
the automated tests for this class.

85
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.565
So looking through the instructions for
this there's a section about how to set up

86
00:04:50.565 --> 00:04:53.280
automated testing for
your assignment repository.

87
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.235
And this is going to allow you to use
a runner that's located on your machine to

88
00:04:58.235 --> 00:05:01.988
check the commits that you
push to the Github Repository.

89
00:05:01.988 --> 00:05:04.867
And verify that they're
working properly or

90
00:05:04.867 --> 00:05:08.361
give you feedback if something
in them is not working.

91
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.109
And follow these instructions from Github,
the instructions are very good.

92
00:05:14.109 --> 00:05:16.255
You can follow these to implement, and

93
00:05:16.255 --> 00:05:20.100
one note though you must use a Linux
based runner for the assignments.

94
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.420
And then you also must ensure that you're
running machine has docker installed.

95
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.305
And there's some instructions about
setting up docker in the setting of your

96
00:05:28.305 --> 00:05:31.066
host section of the assignment
auto test repository.

97
00:05:31.066 --> 00:05:34.654
And that you won't have to worry
about this for the first assignment.

98
00:05:34.654 --> 00:05:38.108
But for the future assignments you
can go back to this page to see how

99
00:05:38.108 --> 00:05:41.451
to reuse a previously configured
runner with a new assignment.

100
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.150
So then once we've got
Github Actions set up and

101
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:52.300
all the unit test requirements,
we can run the unit test script.

102
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.440
And when you run that unit test script,
you're going to see a failure message.

103
00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.230
So next we'll run the unit test script to
run the unit test against our repository.

104
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.238
Now in this case we're running the unit
test against the content that we cloned

105
00:06:05.238 --> 00:06:07.810
from the assignment based
response repository.

106
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.073
So if I look at the content that I have
in my repo it should match what's in

107
00:06:12.073 --> 00:06:13.870
the assignments based repo.

108
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.780
So we haven't implemented anything yet.

109
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.118
We're going to run the unit test, make
sure our unit test is set up properly and

110
00:06:19.118 --> 00:06:22.352
we should get a failure showing that
we haven't completed the assignment

111
00:06:22.352 --> 00:06:23.361
implementation yet.

112
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.161
So I'll run the unit test script.

113
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.601
You should see a building and
running some files,

114
00:06:31.601 --> 00:06:36.010
you should see a message here to say that
your unity setup is working, that's good.

115
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.924
And then you'll see message
with the failure here saying

116
00:06:40.924 --> 00:06:43.291
ASD students please fix me.

117
00:06:43.291 --> 00:06:45.961
So this is the part that will be
adding with assignment number one.

118
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.945
So as the assignment document mentions,
the reason that test is going to fail is

119
00:06:50.945 --> 00:06:54.520
because you haven't yet implemented
your test validate user function.

120
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.671
So if we look at what this function is
doing is just going to verify today.

121
00:06:59.671 --> 00:07:03.636
It's just checking an assertion for
true, that's hard coded defaults, so

122
00:07:03.636 --> 00:07:05.110
it's always going to fail.

123
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.553
You need to replace this line
with a call to my username

124
00:07:09.553 --> 00:07:12.131
to verify your comp username.

125
00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:15.810
So what you're going to do is
add a unity assertion here.

126
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:20.188
That's going to make sure that the string
that you get from your my username

127
00:07:20.188 --> 00:07:24.947
function matches the value from the
configuration file for the assignments.

128
00:07:24.947 --> 00:07:30.155
And the configuration file
value is one that you're

129
00:07:30.155 --> 00:07:35.500
going to fill in, in the camp and
user name.text file.

130
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.888
So you can see here it's referencing
your Github user name here,

131
00:07:38.888 --> 00:07:41.860
you just need to replace this
with your Github user name.

132
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.273
And what you're going to verify with
this function is that the the two values

133
00:07:46.273 --> 00:07:49.631
are equal, so
my username function is written for you.

134
00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:54.221
That's going to get your the I'm
sorry the Malik username from com

135
00:07:54.221 --> 00:07:55.921
files written for you.

136
00:07:55.921 --> 00:07:58.521
That's going to get the value
from the configuration file for

137
00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:00.040
your Github user name.

138
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:05.749
And you're going to call the my username
function and auto test validate.c

139
00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:11.020
to get your hard coded username and
that you're just going to set.

140
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.829
So going back to the assignment
documentation that confuse her name dot

141
00:08:14.829 --> 00:08:17.070
text is going to have
your Github user name.

142
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:22.011
Then test validate user name.c just
needs to have this test assert equal

143
00:08:22.011 --> 00:08:27.940
string message to verify that the two
strings that you return are equal.

144
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:32.014
And the user name is going to be
actually implemented in your auto test

145
00:08:32.014 --> 00:08:33.270
validate.c file.

146
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:38.240
So inside your assignment,
one repository auto test validate.c.

147
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.960
There's a my username function and

148
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.776
you just need to replace this
with your Github users name.

149
00:08:42.776 --> 00:08:46.305
So this is just verifying
that both your comp file and

150
00:08:46.305 --> 00:08:50.840
your c file agree on the setting
of your Github user name.

151
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.533
Now once you run the unit test script, the
unit test portion of the of the testing

152
00:08:55.533 --> 00:08:57.651
for your assignment is going to pass.

153
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.140
So here's an example of what you
should see when you get to that point.

154
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:08.160
If I run the unit test script
should see the same kind of builds.

155
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:13.028
And then instead of failing that last
test case is going to pass because my get

156
00:09:13.028 --> 00:09:17.040
up user name matches between
my comp file and my c file.

157
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.842
Okay, so now that we've got
the basics of our unit test working,

158
00:09:20.842 --> 00:09:24.991
we're going to add some system testing for
a really simple application,

159
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:27.300
we're going to write called Finder app.

160
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:32.312
So Finder apps going to have a couple
of scripts that really do some

161
00:09:32.312 --> 00:09:38.949
basic operations with reading and writing
from files and doing searches on files.

162
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:44.440
And just verified some real basic
operations with shell scripts.

163
00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.661
We're going to write a shell script
that's called finder app Finder.SH.

164
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:53.300
And the requirements for
this script are described here.

165
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.080
It's going to take some
runtime arguments for

166
00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.834
the path to a directory in
the file system and a text string,

167
00:09:59.834 --> 00:10:04.661
that's going to be searched within files
in the directory in the file system.

168
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.620
It needs to exit with
the return value one error.

169
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.605
And to print statements if any of the
parameters weren't specified should exit

170
00:10:13.605 --> 00:10:15.230
with a return value and error.

171
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:20.111
If the file directory does not represent
an actual director in the file system and

172
00:10:20.111 --> 00:10:24.301
it should print the number of files and
the number of matching lines.

173
00:10:24.301 --> 00:10:29.174
Where the X value here is the number
of files in that directory and

174
00:10:29.174 --> 00:10:33.611
all subdirectories and
Y is the number of matching lines.

175
00:10:33.611 --> 00:10:36.029
So if you look back through the content,

176
00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:39.890
we talked about some of the utilities
you can use for scripting.

177
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:44.188
There's just some applications you
can use to get this information and

178
00:10:44.188 --> 00:10:46.706
display it from your Finder invocation.

179
00:10:46.706 --> 00:10:49.467
And so it could be invoked,
something like this,

180
00:10:49.467 --> 00:10:53.018
Finder.SH and then some path to
a directory and then looking for

181
00:10:53.018 --> 00:10:56.261
content in that directory in this case,
the word Lennox.

182
00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.024
Next you're going to write
a shell script called writer,

183
00:11:01.024 --> 00:11:04.480
which takes arguments the full
path of the file to right,

184
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:09.170
including the filename and that's going to
be referred to below as right file.

185
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:12.896
And then the second is a string that
will be written to the file and

186
00:11:12.896 --> 00:11:15.104
you should do some air checking here,

187
00:11:15.104 --> 00:11:18.860
exit with value one if any of
the arguments weren't specified.

188
00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:23.297
Should create a new file with
that specified name and path and

189
00:11:23.297 --> 00:11:26.530
put the content in
the right string into it.

190
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:28.986
And you should overwrite
any existing file,

191
00:11:28.986 --> 00:11:31.577
create that path if it
doesn't already exist.

192
00:11:31.577 --> 00:11:36.502
And it has some error handling if for
some reason the file couldn't be created,

193
00:11:36.502 --> 00:11:39.760
so for example,
writer.sh path to some file name.

194
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.561
IOS this would include the content
IOS inside that file that specifies.

195
00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:50.151
So the next section talks about
the finder test script and

196
00:11:50.151 --> 00:11:52.693
this one you don't have to do anything.

197
00:11:52.693 --> 00:11:55.531
This is a part of the assignment
based repository.

198
00:11:55.531 --> 00:11:58.282
So this is already written for you but

199
00:11:58.282 --> 00:12:02.645
it goes over the counter what
the this file actually does.

200
00:12:02.645 --> 00:12:05.693
And the file is going
to take arguments for

201
00:12:05.693 --> 00:12:10.496
the number of files to write and
the string to write to each files.

202
00:12:10.496 --> 00:12:15.086
And here all the defaults for
what the what this applicator,

203
00:12:15.086 --> 00:12:16.810
what the script does.

204
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:21.047
And it's going to ultimately fill
this temp ALD data directory and

205
00:12:21.047 --> 00:12:25.150
then create the specified number
of files in that directory.

206
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.991
Then it's going to run the finder script
and search for the search string.

207
00:12:29.991 --> 00:12:34.670
And so it should find that it found that
it was able to find the same number of

208
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:38.291
files that it wrote with
the specified right string, and

209
00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:42.681
then checks the output of the finder
script for the expected output.

210
00:12:42.681 --> 00:12:47.870
And then prints that the number of files
matched the expected number of files and

211
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.661
print success or failure.

212
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.574
So when you have your finder and
writer that SH script written,

213
00:12:56.574 --> 00:13:01.488
you should be able to use the finder test
to make sure that both of the scripts

214
00:13:01.488 --> 00:13:06.661
are operating as expected and that your
implementation passes requirement.

215
00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:14.203
So next once we have those scripts
implemented we can use the full test

216
00:13:14.203 --> 00:13:19.530
script to run both the unit test and the
functional test against the application.

217
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:23.233
And so you'll see it start out
by rerunning the unit tests and

218
00:13:23.233 --> 00:13:26.652
then it will run a step here
that runs the finder script.

219
00:13:26.652 --> 00:13:31.121
And also checks to make sure that your
air handling worked as expected on

220
00:13:31.121 --> 00:13:33.436
the finder and writer test scripts.

221
00:13:33.436 --> 00:13:38.266
So if you get a response out here saying
that the assignment test completed with

222
00:13:38.266 --> 00:13:43.261
success then you'll know that you've
implemented your strips successfully.

223
00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:49.520
So once you get everything working
locally, you'll want to push up to your

224
00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:55.323
Github check in your assignment repository
that you created with Github classroom.

225
00:13:55.323 --> 00:13:58.530
And what you should see then if you
have Github Action set up correctly,

226
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.040
you should see a green check box.

227
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:05.216
So this is going to run the full test
script against your self hosted runner and

228
00:14:05.216 --> 00:14:10.568
give you the success status showing
that your test completed successfully.

229
00:14:10.568 --> 00:14:12.322
And under the actions button,

230
00:14:12.322 --> 00:14:16.043
you should be able to see a workflow
run showing a successful run.

231
00:14:16.043 --> 00:14:20.956
And you should be able to see log
messages that show that the outcome of

232
00:14:20.956 --> 00:14:23.020
your run was successful.

233
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.603
If there were any failures,
you'd see error messages here and

234
00:14:26.603 --> 00:14:30.592
refer back to the settings on how to
set up your Github Actions if you see

235
00:14:30.592 --> 00:14:34.740
problems with this step or for
troubleshooting instructions.

236
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.130
So that's really it for
assignment number one.

237
00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:38.704
Pretty simple repository set up,

238
00:14:38.704 --> 00:14:42.430
we'll get into more complicated setups
as we get into the future assignments.

239
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:46.550
But for this one we're just starting out
with the public source and starter code.

240
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:50.805
Then we're going through the step
to create our assignment one

241
00:14:50.805 --> 00:14:53.936
repository based on our Github username,
and

242
00:14:53.936 --> 00:14:58.980
then push the content of our assignment
based repo into that repository.

243
00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.031
And this will be the repository that you
modify and update for the assignment.
